        Filler text is a type of placeholder text that is used to fill up space in a document or a design. Filler text can help to create a realistic layout and test the readability of fonts and colors. Filler text can also be used to demonstrate the structure and format of a document without revealing the actual content. There are different types of filler text, such as lorem ipsum, which is a pseudo-Latin text that has been used since the 16th century, or random words and sentences that are generated by algorithms. Filler text can be useful for various purposes, such as prototyping, testing, editing and proofreading.
